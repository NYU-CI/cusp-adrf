guide-title: Create a Python Virtual Environment
guide-desc: The steps below will walk you through creating a Python virtual environment and kernel so that it may be used in your notebooks.

steps:
  - step-hr: hr
  - step-heading: 1. Open a Terminal.
  - step-instruction: If you're not already logged in, follow the steps found <a href="/login" target="_blank">here</a>. In the upper-right corner, click the <strong>New</strong> button and select <strong>Terminal</strong>.
  - step-image: ve_python_01.png
  - step-hr: hr
  - step-heading: 2. Create virtual environment
  - step-instruction: In the Terminal, enter the command below to create a virtual environment. In this example, <code>myEnv</code> is the name used for the virtual environment, but you may name this whatever you'd like.
  - step-code:
      lang: shell
      code: conda create -n myEnv python=2.7
  - step-instruction: Press return when asked to proceed. All packages needed by the virtual environment will be downloaded and installed.
  - step-image: ve_python_02.png
  - step-hr: hr
  - step-heading: 3. Activate virtual environment
  - step-instruction: Run <code>source activate myEnv</code> to activate your virtual environment. Again, you may have used a different name, so substitute as appropriate. You should now see a prompt with the name of your virtual environment in parenthesis as shown.
  - step-code:
      lang: shell
      code: |
        grahamhenke@bacon:~$ source activate myEnv
        (myEnv) grahamhenke@bacon:~$
  - step-hr: hr
  - step-heading: 4. Install packages
  - step-instruction: "Now that you are in your virtual environment, you may install packages using <code>conda install</code> or <code>pip install</code>. For example, to install the <code>requests</code> package, run:"
  - step-code:
      lang: shell
      code: conda install requests
  - step-note: "Note: We <strong>highly</strong> recommend trying <code>conda install</code> first, as it installs low level dependencies that some packages (such as tensorflow) need. If this does not work, then use <code>pip install</code>."
  - step-hr: hr
  - step-heading: 5. Install ipykernel
  - step-instruction: "To use your virtual environment and the packages installed in it, you will need to create an environment kernel. To do this, you first need to install <code>ipykernel</code> by running the following:"
  - step-code:
      lang: shell
      code: conda install ipykernel
  - step-hr: hr
  - step-heading: 6. Create the kernel
  - step-instruction: "Now create the kernel for your environment by running:"
  - step-code:
      lang: shell
      code: python -m ipykernel install --user --name myEnv --display-name myEnv
  - step-note: "Note: Neither the name or display-name have to be the same as your virtual environment name, but it is recommended to avoid confusion."
  - step-hr: hr
  - step-heading: 7. Open a notebook with the kernel
  - step-instruction: Navigate back to the <strong>Home</strong> tab. Make sure to first <strong>refresh</strong> the page. Next, click the <strong>New</strong> button and select the name of your kernel, which is <strong>myEnv</strong> in this example.
  - step-image: ve_python_03.png
  - step-hr: hr
  - step-heading: 8. Import packages
  - step-instruction: You can now import and use packages from your kernel. Notice the <code>requests</code> package imports successfully.
  - step-note: "Note: Please be aware that common packages you may be used to using (such as pandas) are not installed by default and you will have to explicitly install these using <code>conda install</code> in your virtual environment."
